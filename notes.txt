Blockchain - a distributed ledger that stores 'blocks' containing data
-- 'Trustless' - There is no central body to trust
-- Ledger - a copy of all the transactions -- copies of the the ledger are shared across the network each 'node'
-- Block - the individual peice which makes up the blockchain and named with a 'hash'
--- Hash - Unique value generated from a hash function based on:
																- timestamp stored within the block
																- creation data
																- position in the block
																- hash of the previous block

Digital signatures
-- Cryptography - The layer used for security between transactions in the form of 'digital signatures'
-- Private key - Hash signature used by the individual to create a signature -- private key hash + data hash = public key hash
-- Public key - Hash signature publically available for verification

Wallet
-- Stores the public and private key of an individual
-- Public key is the address of the wallet

Mining
-- 'Unconfirmed' - Transactions that have not yet been processed
-- Proof of work - A block of 'Unconfirmed' transactions are taken and processed through an SHA-256 algorithm (SHA = 'Secure Hash Algorithm", '256' denotes 256 bits or 32 bytes/characters)
--- The first miner that completes the block algorithm gets to add the block to the ledger.
---- This miner is rewarded with cryptocurrency for completing the block.

Multiple Chain Validation
-- In an instance where two or more miners simutaniously add new blocks, the system will wait for a miner which adds more blocks or a 'longer chain' before chain update, and then adds the other blocks
-- This is to ensure that all the blocks get updated and everyone has the same copy, regardless of block update timing.

Hash Validation
-- Checks hash value of every chain
--- If the hash does not match, then it is discarded

BASH terminal:

//creates package.json file
npm init -y

//'nodemon' (as development depandancy) -- Works like Node but has live development server
npm i nodemon --save-dev

//'crypto-js' module -- Contains SHA-256 function
npm i crypto-js --save

//'jest' module (as development depandancy) -- Test runner that can run files with the '*.test.js' extension
npm i jest --save-dev
