Blockchain - a distributed ledger that stores 'blocks' containing data
-- 'Trustless' - There is no central body to trust
-- Ledger - a copy of all the transactions -- copies of the the ledger are shared across the network each 'node'
-- Block - the individual peice which makes up the blockchain and named with a 'hash'
--- Hash - Unique value generated from a hash function based on:
																- timestamp stored within the block
																- creation data
																- position in the block
																- hash of the previous block

Digital signatures
-- Cryptography - The layer used for security between transactions in the form of 'digital signatures'
-- Private key - Hash signature used by the individual to create a signature -- private key hash + data hash = public key hash
-- Public key - Hash signature publically available for verification

Wallet
-- Stores the public and private key of an individual
-- Public key is the address of the wallet

Mining
-- 'Unconfirmed' - Transactions that have not yet been processed
-- Proof of work - A block of 'Unconfirmed' transactions are taken and processed through an SHA-256 algorithm.
--- The first miner that completes the block algorithm gets to add the block to the ledger.
---- This miner is rewarded with cryptocurrency for completing the block.
